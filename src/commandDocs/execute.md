`{{defaultPrefix}}execute` is a joke from the early days of ToastrBot's development. All of the orders are based on the known [150 Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Contingency_Orders_for_the_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic:_Order_Initiation,_Orders_1_Through_150) (GAR).
