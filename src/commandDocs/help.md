ToastrBot helps manage and enrich communities. It's built to be extensible so that it can support _any_ community! It's also designed to be manageable entirely from its chat interface. Here are a couple of commands to help get you started:

`{{defaultPrefix}}commands`
List all commands currently available via the bot.

`{{defaultPrefix}}perms list`
List who can use what commands. Helpful if you're getting `permission denied` errors when trying to use a command.
